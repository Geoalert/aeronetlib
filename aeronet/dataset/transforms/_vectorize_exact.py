"""
    Here we assume that the input contours are not intersecting apart from the cases when one is fully inside another.
    The contours may be inlied in one another, which means that the inner contours are holes in the current one,
    and the inner contour of a hole is a new contour of a class.

    We will represent it as separate polygons, when every new one within a hole is a new Feature.

    The implications are:
    - if two contours intersect, one of them lies within the other
    - the intersecting contour of the smallest area that is greater than the area of current contour is the direct parent
    - we establish a two-layer hierarchy when the contour is either an outer boundary or an inner hole.
